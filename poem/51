THE EMIGRANT'S SONG.


I.

No work, no home, no wealth have I,
But Mary loves me true,
And, for her sake, upon my knees
I'd beg the wide world through:
For her sweet eyes look into mine
With fondness soft and deep;
My heart's entranced, and I could die
Were death a conscious sleep.


II.

But life is work, and work is life,
And life's the way to heaven,
And hand-in-hand we'd like to go
The road that God has given.
And England, dear old Motherland,
Has plenty mouths to feed
Without her sons and daughters fair,
Whose strength is as their need.


III.

To Canada! To Canada!
To that fair land I'll roam,
And till the soil with heart of grace,
For Mary and a home.
Hurrah for love! Hurrah for hope!
Hurrah for industry!
Hurrah for bonnie Canada,
And her bonnie maple tree!
